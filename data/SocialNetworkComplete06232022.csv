When Eliot met her in 1841, she was already in her fifth year of marriage to Charles Bray. Eliot met the couple when she and her father moved to Coventry, and the group grew close rapidly. Eliot, Cara, and Sara Hennell (Cara's sister) became lifelong friends, forming a sisterly bond and supporting one another in their broad-ranging studies and writing. <span>The Brays' influence may have led Eliot to question her religious faith.&nbsp;</span>Especially during her religious disagreements with her father, Eliot found a second home at Rosehill,the name of the Brays' estate.</p>
<p>Even after she moved to London to become a journalist and editor, Eliot remained close to the Brays and Sara, writing them long letters and frequently spending holidays with them. Though they disliked Lewes, and rarely visited after 1854, the friendship continued to Eliot's last days.<br /><br />Cara and Charles Bray seem to have had marital problems or had chosen to have an unconventional marriage; Cara found love with Edward Noel, and Charles bore six children with another woman, one of which Cara accepted into her home as if she were her own child. Evidence of the Brays' complicated marital situation makes even more curious their sanctimonious response to Eliot's illicit relationship with George Henry Lewes. After six years of separation and few letters, Cara and Marian were reunited in 1859, at which time Marian revealed she was George Eliot, the now-famous author of <em>Adam Bede</em>. Eliot encouraged Cara to author several works of her own. When Eliot married John Cross, Cara gave her blessing. She was left a sum of money in Eliot's will.</p>",,,"<em>George Eliot Archive</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, https://GeorgeEliotArchive.org",,,,"To: 1:267, 1:284, 1:291, 1:295, 1:321, 1:329, 1:336, 1:341, 1:346, 1:363, 1:371, 1:373, 1:374, 1:376, 1:377, 2:3, 2:9, 2:10, 2:12, 2:15, 2:16, 2:20, 2:22, 2:23, 2:25, 2:27, 2:29, 2:31, 2:32, 2:34, 2:36, 2:41, 2:42, 2:51, 2:55, 2:58, 2:59, 2:60, 2:65, 2:66, 2:67, 2:68, 2:69, 2:74, 2:75, 2:81, 2:84, 2:87, 2:88, 2:89, 2:90, 2:92, 2:96, 2:97, 2:99, 2:100, 2:102, 2:103, 2:111, 2:114, 2:116, 2:117, 2:119, 2:129, 2:135, 2:149, 2:150, 2:155, 2:160, 2:162, 2:163, 2:166, 2:213, 2:217, 2:313, 2:338, 2:397, 2:443, 2:500, 3:19, 3:22, 3:29, 3:32, 3:37, 3:99, 3:122, 3:137, 3:170, 3:321, 3:344, 3:345, 3:436, 3:456, 4:7, 4:10, 4:32, 4:33, 4:87, 4:106, 4:107. 4:113, 4:120, 4:124, 4:136, 4:148, 4:182, 4:194, 4:197, 4:207, 4:267, 4:326, 4:355, 4:356, 4:374, 4:397, 4:404, 4:421, 4:438, 4:477, 4:490, 5:44, 5:46, 5:50, 5:52, 5:54, 5:60, 5:114, 5:136, 5:138, 5:169. 5:173, 5:197, 5:266, 5:383, 5:389, 5:394, 5:418, 5:432, 5:435, 5:443, 5:471, 6:18, 6:32, 6:52, 6:94, 6:95, 6:118, 6:220, 6:283, 6:319, 6:352, 6:425, 7:29, 7:37, 7:40, 7:61, 7:123, 7:189, 7:340, 8:199, 8:276, 8:308, 8:458, 9:153<br /><br />From: 1:180, 1:184, 5:394, 5:395, 7:275, 7:299, 8:119, 8:248<br /><br />About: 1:214, 1:223, 1:224, 1:225, 1:235, 1:236, 1:238, 1:240, 1:241, 1:244, 1:264, 1:268, 1:271, 1:281, 1:303, 1:308, 1:310, 1:316, 1:318, 1:320, 1:324, 1:357, 1:365, 1:367, 3:16, 3:26, 3:53, 3:68, 3:71, 3:87, 3:91, 3:96, 3:141, 3:229, 3:311, 3:316, 3:324, 3:328, 3:338, 3:359, 3:377, 3:382, 3:391, 3:405, 3:429, 3:433, 3:439, 3:445, 3:452, 3:469, 4:12, 4:49, 4:72, 4:75, 4:82, 4:89, 4:90, 4:93, 4:105, 4:109, 4:128, 4:135, 4:138, 4:144, 4:145, 4:147, 4:153, 4:173, 4:177, 4:180, 4:193, 4:206, 4:235, 4:269, 4:297, 4:360, 4:363, 4:371, 4:401, 4:424, 4:488, 9:102",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"colleagues,family,Family & Friends of George Eliot,friends,George Eliot's colleagues,George Eliot's friends,George Eliot's relations,George Eliot's Social Network,relationship map,relationship web,Social Network",https://georgeeliotarchive.org/files/original/55b9a23c4e6044ed69e3302eca7de471.png,Portrait,"George Eliot's Social Network",1,0

3445,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/3445,"Brabant, Robert Herbert (1781-1886)",,"Dr. Robert Brabant was a physician and the father of one of George Eliot’s good friends, Elizabeth&nbsp; Rebecca Brabant, who was usually called “Rufa.” Dr. Brabant met Eliot in 1843, when she was a bridesmaid in Rufa’s and Charles Hennell’s wedding. Immediately after, Dr. Brabant invited Eliot to stay with him and his wife at Devries for a few months “to fill the place of his daughter” (Haight, <em>GE</em>, 49). <br /><br />George Eliot deeply admired Brabant, who spoke to her as an intellectual equal and began mentoring her in German during her extended visit. She warmly described her living arrangements in letters to friends until she was unexpectedly asked to leave. Apparently, Brabant’s wife had become suspicious of the inappropriate closeness developing between her husband and the appreciative young woman. <br /><br />After Eliot moved to London in 1851, Brabant became a regular visitor who sometimes escorted her to the theater. Some of Eliot’s letters describe displeasure with Brabant’s presence at this time and mock him. After Eliot began living with George Henry Lewes in 1854, she and Brabant lost touch. Gordon Haight and several other critics believe Brabant to be the primary inspiration for Eliot’s character Casaubon in <em>Middlemarch</em>.",,,"<em>George Eliot Archive</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, https://GeorgeEliotArchive.org",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"colleagues,family,Family & Friends of George Eliot,friends,George Eliot's colleagues,George Eliot's friends,George Eliot's relations,George Eliot's Social Network,relationship map,relationship web,Social Network",https://georgeeliotarchive.org/files/original/b652cf9d03b6ad1ef14a6cf860e8857f.jpeg,Portrait,"George Eliot's Social Network",1,0
2795,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/2795,"Bray, Charles (1811-1894)",,"Charles Bray, married to Caroline ""Cara"" Hennell, was a ribbon manufacturer in Coventry. Bray's circle of friends welcomed George Eliot in 1841 and Bray became a close friend in the years after. Perhaps one of Bray's draws for Eliot was his philanthropic nature; Bray set up help for out-of-work ribbon workers, along with several other charitable attempts aimed at relieving poverty. <br /><br />Bray was the owner of the <em>Coventry Herald</em> and <em>Observer</em>, which gave Eliot her first opportunity to publish her writing. Bray himself published several works, along with <em>Philosophy of Necessity</em>, which asserted that the laws of the mind were set. This system appealed to Eliot, who found intellectual stimulus among Bray's circle of friends. She stayed so often with the couple that Rosehill was like a second home to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bray had an extended affair with Hannah Steane, who bore six children with Bray. It is not certain if Eliot was aware of the Brays’ unusual marital situation. Charles Bray was one of the first Eliot confided in about her relationship with Lewes (though, notably, she did not confide in Cara). For several years after Eliot began living with Lewes, her relationship with the Brays grew distant; they disliked Lewes and the couple never visited Rosehill together, though it had been Eliot’s home-away-from-home for many years. Later, financial setbacks forced the Brays to leave their Rosehill estate and move to more modest housing. Eventually, the Brays reunited with Eliot and they remained fast friends until her death.",,"<a href=""https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/ger/83/"">https://digitalcommons.unl.edu/ger/83/</a>","<em>George Eliot Archive</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, https://GeorgeEliotArchive.org",,,,"2:6, 2:8, 2:9, 2:11, 2:14, 2:17, 2:20, 2:20, 2:22, 2:23, 2:26, 2:27, 2:31, 2:32, 2:34, 2:36, 2:37, 2:38, 2:42, 2:43, 2:46, 2:50, 2:56, 2:58, 2:59, 2:60, 2:65, 2:67, 2:68, 2:69, 2:71, 2:71, 2:73, 2:73, 2:74, 2:75, 2:79, 2:79, 2:81, 2:82, 2:83, 2:83, 2:84, 2:88, 2:89, 2:90, 2:92, 2:93, 2:94, 2:96, 2:99, 2:99, 2:100, 2:101, 2:113, 2:116, 2:116, 2:117, 2:121, 2:122, 2:123, 2:125, 2:131, 2:136, 2:139, 2:158, 2:161, 2:165, 2:170, 2:178, 2:183, 2:184, 2:188, 2:197, 2:199, 2:200, 2:201, 2:202, 2:204, 2:209, 2:215, 2:218, 2:221, 2:224, 2:232, 2:234, 2:252, 2:260, 2:261, 2:262, 2:267, 2:279, 2:279, 2:284, 2:287, 2:396, 2:402, 2:414, 2:510

2770,https://georgeeliotarchive.org/items/show/2770,"Lewes, George Henry (1817-1878)",,"A productive writer and critic, George Henry Lewes lived with George Eliot from 1854 until his death in 1878. Though little is known of his childhood, Lewes appears to have grown up plagued with financial problems and an unstable family unit. He found work as a clerk, and eventually attempted to break into the literary scene with a biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley. After meeting Shelley's friend Leigh Hunt, he hoped to forge a personal connection with Shelley's widow, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley. Unfortunately for Lewes, Shelley's widow would not support the proposed biography. While the biography did not come to fruition, Leigh Hunt and his son Thornton Hunt remained a part of Lewes's life. <br /><br />Lewes's wife, Agnes, birthed three children to Lewes (Charles, Thornton, and Herbert), but by the late 1840s, their domestic relationship was withering. Because of his own beliefs in free sexual relations, probably borrowed from Shelley, Lewes allowed and perhaps even approved when Thornton Hunt began a sexual relationship with Agnes, which produced the first of four children in 1850. Lewes signed his name to the birth certificates for even Hunt's children, which made divorce options complicated if not impossible later on. <br /><br />While Lewes became successful in his writing endeavors, he fell into a great depression because of his domestic life. Even as he garnered praise for his works, including his popular <i>A Biographical History of Philosophy</i> and his many articles written for various magazines, Lewes did not recover from his depression until he met George Eliot through a common friend, Herbert Spencer. The two became lovers, perhaps as early as 1853, and by July 1854, when Lewes and Eliot traveled to Germany together and stayed on the continent for nearly 8 months, they had established themselves as a couple. Lewes went to Germany to conduct research for his <em>Life of Goethe</em>, while Eliot ostensibly joined him to provide German-to-English translation assistance. As it turned out, Lewes's <em>Life of Goethe</em>, which never mentions Eliot, not only enjoyed several reprintings during Lewes's lifetime but also was his most successful work. Lewes turned to more scientific articles after his Goethe biography, including a series of articles (later collected in book form) on marine life written while he and Eliot travelled to the English and Welsh coasts. Lewes sent his two elder sons to boarding school on the continent, possibly to save them from the gossip that plagued Lewes and Eliot in England. It took Lewes three years to reveal to his sons the fact of his relationship with Eliot. Thrilled to learn she was the celebrity author of <i>Adam Bede</i>, the boys accepted her and eventually would call her ""Mutter.""<br /><br />It was Lewes's support that encouraged Eliot to begin writing fiction. From the beginning, Lewes acted as an intermediary between Eliot and her publishers. While their relationship undoubtedly was vital in motivating George Eliot, some critics question Lewes's methods of isolating her from negative feedback. However, Lewes evidently found pleasure rather than jealousy in her success and wrote adoringly of her in letters to friends. <br /><br />In his later years, Lewes became editor to several important magazines, including the <i>Cornhill Magazine</i> in 1862 and the <i>Fortnightly Review</i> in 1865. Two of his children moved to Africa in this period to farm, though his son Thornton, ""Thornie,"" moved back in 1869 after contracting spinal meningitis. Lewes and Eliot nursed him until his death in that year. Herbert, ""Bertie,"" his youngest son died also, of tuberculosis, in Africa before he could return to England. At the end of his life, Lewes strove to complete his 5-volume magnum opus, <i>Problems of Life and Mind,</i> that combined physiology and psychology. The final two volumes would have remained unfinished had Eliot not picked up the pen after Lewes's death. Lewes was praised posthumously by many of his contemporaries for his long, successful life as a writer.",,,"<em>George Eliot Archive</em><span>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett,

<p>The two corresponded faithfully after Eliot left the school and Maria was usually spent her holidays with Eliot and her father in their Coventry home. <span>Lewis's Evangelical Christian beliefs had for many years influenced Eliot's; by 1841, however, Eliot had begun to question and doubt.

This act caused a rift with Maria, which was not resolved until 1874, when Eliot learned Lewis's address and began sending her a yearly gift of money.

After basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father's trade and then set up a carpentry business. A local landowner, Francis Parker noticed his ability and invited him in 1802 to manage an estate he had inherited in Derbyshire. In 1806, after the death of Sir Roger Newdigate, Francis Parker inherited the Arbury estate near Nuneaton in Warwickshire and once again asked Evans to manage it. This began a long career in estate management, where Evans earned the reputation of being fair, honest, and hard working.<br /><br />Evans married twice. His first wife was a servant of the Parker family, Harriet Poynton, who had two children and died giving birth to a third in 1809. Evans remarried to a farmer's daughter, Christiana, who gave birth to three children: Christiana 'Chrissey', Isaac, and Mary Ann (the future George Eliot). She also gave birth to twin boys in 1821 who did not survive childbirth. Eliot was apparently much closer to her father than to her mother, about whom she writes almost nothing.<br /><br />When Christiana died, Eliot took over much of the domestic work in the house and became indispensable to her father. Evans encouraged Eliot's intellectual development and paid for tutors in German and Italian. Eventually, Evans retired and his son Isaac took over the estate management in 1841. Evans and Eliot moved to Coventry, where a dispute soon arose after Eliot began interacting with the radical Brays. Evans, who benefited from the support of the upper class in his life, was a staunch conservative. Eventually, Eliot announced that she could no longer believe in Christianity and refused to accompany him to church, which infuriated her father. It took several weeks and an intervention from Isaac to mend the rift. Evans' health began to decline in 1845, and for the next four years as his health declined, Eliot devoted herself to caring for him. He passed away in 1849. The experience left a strong impression on Eliot, whose fiction frequently includes scenes of tending loved ones at the time of their deaths.",,"<a href=""https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02149/Robert-Evans?LinkID=mp01506&amp;search=sas&amp;sText=robert+evans&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=0"">https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/portrait/mw02149/Robert-Evans?LinkID=mp01506&amp;search=sas&amp;sText=robert+evans&amp;role=sit&amp;rNo=0</a>","<em>George Eliot Archive</em>, edited by Beverley Park Rilett, https://georgeeliotarchive.org",,,,"4:130, 4:140, 4:299, 4:306

Isaac and Eliot spent their childhood as constant companions until being sent to separate boarding schools. While aging and separation did cause some distance, the two remained on good terms while they both lived in the Warwickshire country of their upbringing. When Eliot was still living with her father in Coventry, Isaac and his wife, Sarah, offered their own house for her to stay in despite a previous falling out over Eliot's refusal to attend church. After their father retired, Isaac Evans took over the family business of estate management and also seemed to take on some of his social expectations.<br /><br />Eliot avoided telling her family of her relationship with George Henry Lewes for three years; when she did finally tell Isaac in 1857 that she had a 'husband,' her brother quickly found out the truth--that she was living with an already-married man. Consequently, he cut off all communication with her and demanded their sisters Fanny and Chrissey do the same. Evans did not speak to his sister for 23 years, though his wife did send condolences to Eliot when Lewes died. The silence was not broken until Evans heard of Eliot's marriage to John Cross, where he wrote to her with congratulations. The two exchanged letters, saying they were still fond of each other even after the long separation. Before they could be reunited in person, Eliot unexpectedly died. Evans seemed to feel true sorrow, to the extent that he made the difficult trek during winter to attend her funeral in London.

While Eliot found his appearance undistinguished, showing none of the benevolence she had expected, she was still impressed by having met him, describing him as a “man one can thoroughly enjoy talking to.” After having read the first of the two stories in <em>Scenes of Clerical Life</em>, Dickens wrote to Eliot through her publisher, praising the “exquisite truth and delicacy, both of the humour and the pathos” in them, and maintaining that the masculine name of the author did not convince him: “If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself, mentally, so like a woman, since the world began.” Eliot was deeply moved by this, but was unable to write back to him to express her appreciation due to “the iron mask of [her] incognito.” <br />After the publication of <em>Adam Bede</em>, Dickens wrote to her directly, announcing the pleasure in being able to address her as a woman and warmly praising the novel. Back in 1853, Lewes had attacked Dickens in his weekly paper, <em>The Leader</em>, over the lack of scientific realism in <em>Bleak House</em>, specifically, the spontaneous combustion of Mr. Krook. Dickens took offense and the friendship was strained for several years, but in November of 1859, Dickens put aside any remaining bitterness and accepted a visit to Eliot and Lewes’s home, where he met George Eliot in person for the first time. He hoped to convince her to write for his journal, <em>All the Year Round</em>, but she did not accept the invitation.

D'Albert later burned the letters, fearing that they might be misinterpreted.

Eighteen months after Lewes's death, in May, 1880, Eliot and Cross married at St. George’s, Hanover Square. This development shocked most of Eliot’s friends, none of whom were invited to the ceremony. Edith Simcox, who had witnessed jealously the closeness developing, was singularly unsurprised. After the wedding, Cross and Eliot left for a honeymoon trip to Italy. However, Cross suffered from bouts of depression and, while in Venice, according to police reports, threw himself from the window of their hotel into the Grand Canal. He was rescued by gondoliers and with the help of his older brother, whom Eliot had summoned to Venice following the crisis, was able to return to England and to the marriage as if nothing of consequence had happened.

Eliot supported Bodichon in many of her political acts, including petitioning parliament to pass a Married Women's Property Bill to protect married women’s earnings. Both women had been involved with the married John Chapman, who attempted to convince Bodichon to have a sexual relationship with him, using Lewes and Eliot’s unsanctioned domestic partnership as a positive example. <br />In 1857, Bodichon married a French doctor and lived abroad in Algiers half the year. Barbara Bodichon was the first to recognize Eliot's <i>Adam Bede</i> as the work of her friend, which delighted the author. Along with Emily Davies, Bodichon founded Girton College, Cambridge, the first university open to women, which Eliot supported with a modest financial donation. After Bodichon suffered from a stroke in 1877, she left to live in Sussex and the women rarely saw one another after that.
