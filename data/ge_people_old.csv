Blackwood at first dealt exclusively with George Henry Lewes to publish Eliot's works. Eventually, after he had nurtured a supportive relationship as publisher of Eliot's first works of fiction, <i>Scenes of Clerical Life </i>and <i>Adam Bede</i>, Eliot revealed her identity to Blackwood. Even after Eliot moved on to publish <i>Romola </i>with George Smith, who offered much higher payment than Blackwood could afford, Blackwood remained friendly.

Blackwood's firm eventually published all of Eliot's works except for <i>Romola</i>, which was sold instead to George Smith, a rival publisher. Interestingly, John's brother Major William Blackwood, attempted to dissuade his brother from publishing <i>Adam Bede</i> for its scandalous themes.

Bodichon's parents were not married, which isolated Bodichon from gentle society. After Eliot began living unmarried with Lewes, Bodichon became an especially close friend, one who could sympathize with social shunning.  Eliot supported Bodichon in many of her political acts, including petitioning parliament to pass a Married Women's Property Bill to protect married women's earnings. Both women had been involved with the married John Chapman, who attempted to convince Bodichon to have a sexual affair with him. In 1857, Bodichon married a French doctor and lived abroad in Algiers half the year. She was the first to recognize George Eliot's <i>Adam Bede</i> as the work of Marian Evans, something that delighted Eliot. Bodichon, along with Emily Davies, founded Girton College in Cambridge, the first university open to women, which Eliot supported with a modest financial donation. After Bodichon suffered from a stroke in 1877, she left to live in Sussex and the women rarely saw one another after that. Although Bodichon was surprised to read of Eliot's marriage to John Cross, she heartily wished them well. Bodichon was one of the last people Eliot wrote to before her death.",Regular,,,,"30, 62, 67",31-33,,,"I,  xii,  xviii,  xliv,  xlviii, 1,  account  of,  liii-lv; Bessie writes  her about GE,  II,  9;  16,  30,  32, introduced tQ GE,  40;  of  the  tabooed  family,  45; desire  to  impress  GE, 65;  87, 106, 109, Ù„174, illness, 196; writes GE; her strong, noble nature, 2ll; petition for  MarriedWomen's  Property  Bill,  225-7;  229,  love affair  with  J.

When Eliot met her in 1841, she was already in her fifth year of marriage to Charles Bray. Eliot met the couple when she and her father moved to Coventry, and the group grew close rapidly. Eliot, Cara, and Sara Hennell (Cara's sister) became lifelong friends, forming a sisterly bond and supporting one another in their broad-ranging studies and writing. <span>The Brays' influence may have led Eliot to question her religious faith.&nbsp;</span>Especially during her religious disagreements with her father, Eliot found a second home at Rosehill,the name of the Brays' estate.</p>
<p>Even after she moved to London to become a journalist and editor, Eliot remained close to the Brays and Sara, writing them long letters and frequently spending holidays with them. Though they disliked Lewes, and rarely visited after 1854, the friendship continued to Eliot's last days.<br /><br />Cara and Charles Bray seem to have had marital problems or had chosen to have an unconventional marriage; Cara found love with Edward Noel, and Charles bore six children with another woman, one of which Cara accepted into her home as if she were her own child. Evidence of the Brays' complicated marital situation makes even more curious their sanctimonious response to Eliot's illicit relationship with George Henry Lewes. After six years of separation and few letters, Cara and Marian were reunited in 1859, at which time Marian revealed she was George Eliot, the now-famous author of <em>Adam Bede</em>. Eliot encouraged Cara to author several works of her own. When Eliot married John Cross, Cara gave her blessing. She was left a sum of money in Eliot's will.</p>",,,,,,"25, 35-6",,,"III, 157",

Bray's circle of friends welcomed George Eliot in 1841 and Bray became a close friend in the years after. Perhaps one of Bray's draws for Eliot was his philanthropic nature; Bray set up help for out-of-work ribbon workers, along with several other charitable attempts aimed at relieving poverty. <br /><br />Bray was the owner of the <em>Coventry Herald</em> and <em>Observer</em>, which gave Eliot her first opportunity to publish her writing. Bray himself published several works, along with <em>Philosophy of Necessity</em>, which asserted that the laws of the mind were set. This system appealed to Eliot, who found intellectual stimulus among Bray's circle of friends. She stayed so often with the couple that Rosehill was like a second home to her.&nbsp;<br /><br />Bray had an extended affair with Hannah Steane, who bore six children with Bray. It is not certain if Eliot was aware of the BraysÕ unusual marital situation. Charles Bray was one of the first Eliot confided in about her relationship with Lewes (though, notably, she did not confide in Cara). For several years after Eliot began living with Lewes, her relationship with the Brays grew distant; they disliked Lewes and the couple never visited Rosehill together, though it had been EliotÕs home-away-from-home for many years. Later, financial setbacks forced the Brays to leave their Rosehill estate and move to more modest housing. Eventually, the Brays reunited with Eliot and they remained fast friends until her death.",,,,,"51, 64","37, 39",,,"account  of, I,  lv-lix;  lxxv, 158, 164, 183, 187, 190-1, 19!1-4, 197, 201, 207-8, 2ll,  214,  has  cholera,  223;  buys  Cov; entry Herald, 224; 229, 231, 236, 243,266-8,  284-5,  304,  328,  344,  346, 348, 350,  354,  357,  359,  362-4,  370,    374, birthday,  II,  8;  10.:.I, 13-4,  17,  22, 29- 30,  35,  43,  57,  84,  92-7,  102-3,   110, 128,  144-7,  wedding  anniversary,  153; 155, 160, 164-5, 187, 191, 203, 205, 209, 2ll, 230, sells Rosehill, 234; 256, 264-5,284,  301,  moves  to  Ivy  Cottage,   302, 314;  320,  329, goes  to  Handel Festival,  338-9,  Mrs.  Cash  on,  340;  388-9, 412, 415, 423, 483, 486, III, 16, 27, 71,  plans joke  book,  136,  214,  241,  builds  house at  Sydenham,  3II,  IV,  87;    III,    322,  338,  leaves  Ivy  Cottage  for  Barr's  Hill Terrace,  Coventry,  445;  467, 469, IV, 77-8, 90-1, 125, 136, 147, 149, 157,  159, 169,  184, 193, 198,  210,  213,  232, 268, 296, 298, 314, 356, lets Coventry  house,  360, 363; 4ll, V, 9, 54-5, II5,   131-2,217,  226,  232,  279,  433,  472,  asthma, VI,  92, 94,  VII,  37;  VI, 192,  283, sells  Ivy Cottage, 352; 419, VII, 62, 124,   341 GE and Charles Bray I,   xlix,   GE   meets,   120;   reads   his Philosophy  of  Necessity, I,  124;  Bray makes  phrenological  readings  of  GE, 126, 265; 154, takes  GE  to  Tenby, 160, to  London  for  Rufa's  wedding,  163,  to Lakes, 178; 167, 175, has cast made of  GE's  head, 178;  180, 195,  takes  GE  to Scotland,   199-200,   to  London,  232; 283-4,   takes   GE   abroad,   289;  sends passport,  292:  307,  310,  sends  Herald, 315;  324,  GE  lives  at  Rosehill,  336 -7; 342,  gives  up  his  study  to  GE,  355; takes GE  to London, 365; 366 -7,  373, II,  34,  39-40,  44,  46,  comes  to Broad- stairs,  50;  56,  61,  73,  walks    to    station to  see  GE,  79;  sends Herald, 80;  GE's affection  for,  81-2;  helps  GE  move,  83; GE  recuperates  at  Rosehill,    99;    II5,  ll7,  ll9,  sends  GE  bookcase,  122,  125; 140, 148, sees GEin London, 158; spends day  with  GE,  161;  advancesÙ„  money  to GE,  165, 184;  GE  writes  from  Weimar, 170;  GE  confided  facts  of  her  relation  to  GHL  only  to  Bray  and  Chapman, 179,  181-2,  183,  VII,  387;  advises GE on  business,  II,  197:  warned  not  to  mis - quote    GE's    remark    on    GHL,    199;  lends  Scott's  novels,    201,    215;    visits GE,  204;  guesses  authorship  of  ""Cum- ming""   article,   218;   GE   gives   GHL's Goethe to,  221;  invites  GE  to  stop  at Rosehill,  224;    GE    offershim    a    bed, 234; 237, 252, 259-60, visits GE,   261-2,269; GE refuses to visit Rosehill, 279; visits GE at Richmond, 287; 306, sus- pects GE of writing a novel, 443; 490, 505,  sends  GE  oysters,  510;  5ll,  III, 87,  GE  reveals  incognito  to, 90; 91, GE gives Bray Scenes and Adam, 121; calls  R.

In 1875, Browning was dismissed as schoolmaster at Eton for rumors of homosexual advances. He returned to Cambridge where he strove to advance the study of history at the university and wrote historical works in his retirement. Browning wrote <i>The Life of George Eliot</i> in 1890, which brought details from John Walter Cross and Browning's own personal interactions with Eliot together. According to Henry James in a letter to his sister Alice in 1881, Browning had a theory that Eliot discovered something unsavory in Lewes' notes after his death and desired to go back on Lewes.

Lewes wrote him a long letter of explanation after the scandal broke in England that he was living abroad with the unmarried Marian Evans, which seemed to partially but incompletely heal their wounded friendship.

In addition, Eliot had also published 'Poetry and Prose from the Notebook of an Eccentric' serially in the Coventry Herald and Observer. Evans boarded at Chapman's home when she first moved to London to work for the Review and may have had a brief affair with him, to the irritation of Chapman's wife and mistress. After a short period during which she returned to Coventry, Chapman convinced her to return to his London home, apparently promising that their relationship would henceforth be strictly professional. A testament to their close friendship, Chapman was one of the few people Evans told about her relationship with Lewes before leaving for Germany with him. In the years of George Eliot's rising fame, Chapman pushed to discover and then revealed to others that Evans was actually George Eliot, the secret author of <i>Adam Bede</i>.

Susanna Chapman ran a boarding house where many writers for the journal lived, including George Eliot.&nbsp;<br /><br />Susanna was older than John by fourteen years and much wealthier. Her inheritance from her lace manufacturing father allowed John to purchase properties and businesses after they moved to London. His poor money management skills strained the marriage.</p>
<p>Susanna Chapman bore four children, though one died in infancy and another with special needs was adopted by Susanna's brother. &nbsp;<br /><br />John Chapman and George Eliot may have been lovers while she was living in their boarding house, according to <span>biographer Gordon Haight, who gleaned suggestive evidence from John Chapman's diary. The</span>&nbsp;diary showed that the Chapmans' nanny was also having an affair with John.

In response to a short letter from Maria on the eve of the wedding, Eliot responded with a promise that Charles Lewes would explain 'a great, momentous change' that was coming: her marriage to John Cross.

Eighteen months after Lewes's death, in May, 1880, Eliot and Cross married and left soon after on a wedding tour on the continent. The pair seemed to be quite happy. However, Cross suffered from bouts of depression and, while in Venice, according to police reports, threw himself from the window of their hotel into the Grand Canal. He was rescued by gondoliers and with the help of his older brother, whom Eliot had summoned to Venice following the crisis, returned to England. There, Cross appeared to return to normal.

Eliot wrote to the Brays professing to love D'Albert as both a brother and father, claiming that she had 'not heard a word or seen a gesture of his yet that was not perfectly in harmony with an exquisite moral refinement'indeed one feels a better person always when he is present'. Due to physical deformity in his spine caused by a childhood injury, some believe D'Albert to be the model of Philip Wakem in <i>Mill on the Floss</i>. D'Albert painted the portrait of Eliot in February 1850, which now hangs in the Herbert Art Gallery in Coventry. When it became time for Eliot to return to England, she was very sad to leave the D'Alberts, and he accompanied her all the way to England as a measure of protection. After his return to Geneva, the two kept in touch by letters, written in French. Eliot addressed him in the familiar form after obtaining permission from his wife, Julie, to do so. D'Albert later burned the letters, fearing that they might be misinterpreted. Upon the revelation that Marian had 'married' George Henry Lewes and that she had become the novelist George Eliot, D'Albert responded that he had already read <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i> and expressed interest in translating it to French.

While Eliot found his appearance undistinguished, showing none of the benevolence she had expected, she was still impressed by having met him, describing him as a &#34;man one can thoroughly enjoy talking to&#34;. In July of 1856, Eliot wrote a review article entitled 'The Natural History of German Life' in which she offered criticism of Dickens' works without naming him, finding fault in Dickens's characters who are portrayed only in outward appearance, idioms, and manners. In doing this, she was indicating that her novels would be different in that her characters would be portrayed realistically without the added sentimentalist and romanticized views in Dickens's novels. After having read the first of the two stories in <i>Scenes of Clerical Life</i>, Dickens wrote to Eliot praising the &#34;exquisite truth and delicacy, both of the humour and the pathos&#34; in them, and maintaining that the masculine name of the author did not convince him: &#34;If they originated with no woman, I believe that no man ever before had the art of making himself, mentally, so like a woman, since the world began&#34;. Eliot was both deeply moved by this, but was unable to write back to him to express her appreciation due to her anonymity. Dickens invited Eliot to write for <i>All the Year Round</i> in 1859, but she did not accept the invitation until she had revealed her true identity to the world.

Isaac and Eliot spent their childhood as constant companions until being sent to separate boarding schools. While aging and separation did cause some distance, the two remained on good terms while they both lived in the Warwickshire country of their upbringing. When Eliot was still living in Coventry with her father and they had a falling out over her refusal to attend church, Isaac and his wife, Sarah, offered their own house for her to stay in. After their father retired, Isaac Evans took over the family business of estate management and also seemed to take on some of his social expectations. Eliot avoided telling her family of her relationship with George Henry Lewes for three years; when she did finally tell him in 1857 that she had a 'husband,' her brother quickly found out the truth'that she was living with an already-married man. Consequently, he cut off all communication with her and demanded their sisters Fanny and Chrissey do the same. Evans did not speak to his sister for 23 years, though his wife did send condolences to Eliot when Lewes died. The silence was not broken until Evans heard of Eliot's marriage to John Cross, where he wrote to her with congratulations. The two exchanged letters, saying they were still fond of each other even after the long separation. Before they could be reunited in person, Eliot unexpectedly died. Evans seemed to feel true sorrow, to the extent that he made the difficult trek during winter to attend her funeral in London.

After basic schooling, he was apprenticed to his father's trade and then set up a carpentry business. A local landowner, Francis Parker noticed his ability and invited him in 1802 to manage an estate he had inherited in Derbyshire. In 1806, after the death of Sir Roger Newdigate, Francis Parker inherited the Arbury estate near Nuneaton in Warwickshire and once again asked Evans to manage it. This began a long career in estate management, where Evans earned the reputation of being fair, honest, and hard working. Evans married twice. His first wife was a servant of the Parker family, Harriet Poynton, who had two children and died giving birth to a third in 1809. Evans remarried to a farmer's daughter, Christiana, who gave birth to three children: Christiana (Chrissey), Isaac, and Mary Ann (the future George Eliot). She also gave birth to twin boys in 1821 who did not survive childbirth. Eliot was apparently much closer to her father than to her mother, about whom she writes almost nothing. When Christiana died, Eliot took over much of the domestic work in the house and became indispensable to her father. Evans encouraged Eliot's intellectual development and paid for tutors in German and Italian. Eventually, Evans retired and his son Isaac took over the estate management in 1841. Evans and Eliot moved to Coventry, where a dispute soon arose after Eliot began interacting with the radical Brays. Evans, who benefited from the support of the upper class in his life, was a staunch conservative. Eventually, Eliot announced that she could no longer believe in Christianity and refused to accompany him to church, which infuriated her father. It took several weeks and an intervention from Isaac to mend the rift. Evans' health began to decline in 1845, and for the next four years as his health declined, Eliot devoted herself to caring for him. He passed away in 1849. The experience left a strong impression on Eliot, whose fiction frequently includes scenes of tending loved ones at the time of their deaths.",,,,,,,,,,

Both women were intellectuals and the two quickly became close friends, though Sara tended to focus more on theology, which Eliot had left behind. Hennell aided Eliot in her earlier translation of <i>Das Lebel Jesu</i>. While Hennell disapproved of Eliot's choice in being with George Henry Lewes, Sara still wrote letters proclaiming her love.

Lewes,Jervis,,Agnes,,"8:164, 8:174, 8:190",agnes_jervis_lewes.png,,,family,5,1822,1902,"<p>In 1841, George Henry Lewes married Agnes Jervis. Agnes had been well-educated by her radical, literary father, enough so that she was able to help Lewes with a number of the works he would submit to magazines and periodicals. Agnes gave birth to five children of Lewes's, three of whom survived past infancy: Charles Lee Lewes, Thornton Arnott Lewes, and Herbert Arthur Lewes. By 1849, Agnes had begun a relationship affair with Lewes's close friend and business partner Thornton Leigh Hunt, which would result in four children. Despite the affair, which Lewes had full knowledge of, Lewes and Agnes continued to live together for several years. Lewes registered the first two of Agnes and Hunt's children as his own and all four carried his name, which made filing for divorce from Agnes on the grounds of her adultery problematic.</p>
<p>Whether Lewes left Agnes in 1852, Ô53, or Ô54 remains uncertain; Herbert Spencer reported many years later that Lewes had been separated from Agnes for two years before he began living with Eliot, however letters from Lewes were addressed from his home with Agnes into 1854. Even after Lewes left Agnes and began his relationship with Eliot, he spent at least one Christmas holiday with the family instead of with Eliot. Until his death, Lewes continued to send money to Agnes to cover her expenses and debts, for which he was legally obligated.</p>",,,,,21,,,,"(Mrs.  George  Henry Lewes,  1822-1902),  account  of,  I,  xiv, lxviii-lxx;  has  4  children    by  GHL  and 4  by  T.

1854 to his death in 1878. Lewes most likely grew up plagued with financial problems, though little is known of his childhood. He may have found work as a clerk, and eventually attempted to break into the literary scene with a biography of Percy Bysshe Shelley. Lewes planned to use a personal connection with Shelleys widow, Mary Wollstonecraft Shelley, through her acquaintance Leigh Hunt. While the biography did not come to fruition, as Mary was not supportive of it, Leigh Hunt and his son Thornton Hunt remained a part of Lewess life. Lewes's wife, Agnes, birthed three children to Lewes (Charles, Thornton, and Bertie), but by the late 1840s, their domestic relationship was withering. Because of his own beliefs in free sexual relations, probably borrowed from Shelley, Lewes allowed and perhaps even approved when Thornton Hunt began a sexual relationship with Agnes, which produced the first of four children in 1850. Lewes signed his name to the birth certificates for even Hunt's children, which made divorce options complicated if not impossible later on. <br/> While Lewes became successful in his writing endeavors, he fell into a great depression because of his domestic life. Even as he garnered praise for his works, including his popular <i>A Biographical History of Philosophy</i> and his many articles written for various magazines, Lewes did not recover from his depression until he met Marian Evans through a common friend, Herbert Spencer. The two became lovers, perhaps as early as 1853 and by July 1854, when Lewes and Eliot traveled to Germany together and stayed on the continent for nearly 8 months, they had established themselves as a couple. Lewes went to Germany to conduct research for his Life of Goethe, while Marian ostensibly joined him to provide German-to-English translation assistance. As it turned out, Lewes's Life of Goethe, which never mentions Evans, not only enjoyed several reprintings during Lewes's lifetime but also was his most successful work. Lewes turned to more scientific articles after his Goethe biography, including a series of articles (later collected in book form) on marine life written while he and Marian travelled to the English and Welsh coasts. Lewes sent his two elder sons to boarding school on the continent, possibly to save them from the gossip that plagued Lewes and Marian in England. It took Lewes three years to reveal to his sons the fact of his relationship with Marian. Thrilled to learn she was the celebrity author of <i>Adam Bede</i>, the boys accepted her and eventually would call her 'Mutter.' <br/> It was Lewes's support that encouraged Marian to begin writing fiction. From the beginning, Lewes acted as an intermediary between Eliot and her publishers. While their relationship undoubtedly was vital in motivating George Eliot, some critics question Lewes' methods of isolating her from negative feedback. However, Lewes evidently found pleasure rather than jealousy in her success and wrote adoringly of her in letters to friends. <br/> In his later years, Lewes became editor to several important magazines, including <i>The Cornhill Magazine</i> in 1862 and <i>The Fortnightly Review</i> in 1865. Two of his children moved to Africa in this period to farm, though Thornton moved back in 1869 after contracting spinal meningitis. Lewes and Marian nursed him until his death in that year. Bertie died also, of tuberculosis, in Africa before he could return to England. At the end of his life, Lewes strove to complete his 5-volume magnum opus, <i>Problems of Life and Mind</i> that combined physiology and psychology. The final two volumes would have remained unfinished, had Marian not picked up the pen after Lewes' death. Lewes was praised posthumously by many of his contemporaries for his long, successful life as a writer.",,,,,74,213-223,,,"VII, 100; GE  asks  Allbutt's  advice  on,  VII,  104, 113-4, 117, 124, 127, 128, 141-2, terms of,  176-7,  183,  deed   executed,   194, terms of award, 199, 201, 211, C.

In 1863, Thornie failed his Civil Service exam at Edinburgh. Rather than resit the exam, he instead went to Natal to try farming. His brother Bertie joined him not long after.

When Eliot joined Lewis's school in Nuneaton, Eliot was drawn to Lewis for approval and guidance, feelings that were intensified after Eliot's mother's death. The two corresponded for years after Eliot left the school and Maria even visited Eliot at her father's Coventry home until Eliot stopped attending church. This act caused a rift for many years, which was not resolved until 1874, when Eliot learned Lewis' address and began sending her a yearly amount.

At the age of 38, Parkes married a Frenchman named Louis Belloc and moved to Algiers, France with him. The couple had two children before Belloc died suddenly in 1872, after only 5 years of marriage.  Their children, Marie Belloc Lowndes (1868'1947) and Hilaire Belloc (1870'1953), went on to become renowned writers.",Semi-regular,,,,67,"308, 309, 310",,,,
